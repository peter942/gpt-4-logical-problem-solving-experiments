# gpt-4-logical-problem-solving-experiments

Here, I'm testing various approaches to problem solving using GPT-4 - the goal is to try to figure out approaches that overcome the limitations and weaknesses of GPT-4 by augmenting it with different reasoning techniques. 

You can run a test version of this app [here](https://peter942-gpt-4-logical-problem-solving-ex-problem-solver-v7hzwx.streamlit.app/) - you'll need to drop in your OpenAI API key with GPT-4 access.
